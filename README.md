I did this calculator which was my firsst project ever.
And i'm personaly happpy of the of it , because it has style and resembles a real calculator in some some aspects like; when you press a button it enters and gives you the sensation you really clicked on the calculator button.
And it has shadow parts which follows the sensation of a click on the calculator.
All of it to say i'm happy of my project after thinking of the time i toook to completly finish my project.
